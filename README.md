This is a very simple prototype to demostrate how Python, NetworkX and HyperNetX library can be used for a simple hypergraph and bipartite graph simulation

Resources related to HyperNetX can be found in https://pnnl.github.io/HyperNetX/build/index.html

For more information on hypergraphs and how hypergraphs are trelated to bipartite graphs, you can have a look at my Linkedin article:
